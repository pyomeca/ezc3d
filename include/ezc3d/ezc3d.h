///
/// This is the document for the library ezc3d
/// (<a href="http://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d">http://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d</a>). The main goal of
/// this library is to eazily create, read and modify c3d (<a href="http://c3d.org">http://c3d.org</a>)
/// files, largely used in biomechanics.
///
/// This documentation was automatically generated for the "Nostalgia" Release 1.1.0 on the 9th of August, 2019.
